# Cowsay App React Front End

This app demonstrates:

1. GraphQL access to a backend API
2. Javascript web token authentication
3. Using useContext React Hook to store authentication state
4. Using useReducer React Hook to add "Redux-like" state flow
5. Debouncing form input validation (not the best idea, in hindsight)

It's meant to be run from the parent, `cowsay`, directory, using `docker-compose up`, as that will launch the backend API and database.

See the `readme` there for more info.
